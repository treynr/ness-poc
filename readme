SYNOPSIS

	gse [OPTIONS] <gs-file> <human> <mouse> <yeast> <output>

ARGUMENTS

	The program requires five arguments, each of which are filepaths.

	gs-file

		Path to a GeneWeaver gene set file. This is an ASCII, tab delimited
		file. Comments are prefixed with '#' and columns with multiple values
		are separated with '|'. The format contains the following columns:
			
			(0)   (1) 	(2) 	 (3)
			GS_ID SP_ID TAXON_ID GENE(S)

	human

		Path to a file containing human annotations. This is an ASCII, tab delimited
		file. Comments are prefixed with '#' and columns with multiple values
		are separated with '||' or '|'. The format contains the following columns:
			
			(0)   (1) 	  (2) 	 	  (3)
			GO_ID GO_TERM DESCRIPTION GENE(S)

		Path to a file containing mouse annotations. Same format as 'human'.

	yeast

		Path to a file containing yeast annotations. Same format as 'human'.

	output

		Path to an output file which will contain GO terms that are
		significantly overrepresented among the provided gene sets. The output
		format is an ASCII, tab delimited file. Comments are prefixed with '#'.
		The format contains the following columns:

			(0)  (1)   (2)
			GENE GO_ID P_VALUE
